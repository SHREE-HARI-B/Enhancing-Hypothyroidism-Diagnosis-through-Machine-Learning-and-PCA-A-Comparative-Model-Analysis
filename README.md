An Analysis on the Accuracy of a Hypothyroid Dataset
Problem Statement

Accurate diagnosis of hypothyroidism is crucial for effective treatment and better patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods often face limitations in handling the complexity of hypothyroidism manifestations. This project bridges the gap by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy, highlighting the critical role of well-curated datasets in developing robust prediction systems.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, requires precise and timely diagnosis. This study examines the potential of machine learning techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy using a comprehensive hypothyroid dataset.

Key components of the study include:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

Model evaluation using Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

Comparative analysis of PCA vs. non-PCA approaches to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction.

Heat map analysis to visualize correlations between clinical features.

Graphical visualizations to enhance interpretability and present model performance results.

Results indicate that Decision Tree and Random Forest models achieve higher accuracy, validating the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Meanwhile, KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression provide insights into the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. This study also discusses the clinical relevance of the identified features, the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, and opportunities for future research.
